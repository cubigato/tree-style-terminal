# Bug Tracker

## Overview
This directory contains bug reports tracked as markdown files. Use the template in `templates/bug-template.md` for new bugs.

## Workflow
1. Create new bugs in `open/` using sequential numbering (001, 002, etc.)
2. Move to `closed/` when resolved (keep same filename)
3. Reference bug numbers in commit messages: `Fix issue (closes #001)`
4. Update this README when adding/closing bugs

## Open Bugs
- [#001](open/001-sidebar-transparency.md) - Sidebar transparency not working with terminal transparency

## Closed Bugs
None yet.

## Statistics
- Open: 1
