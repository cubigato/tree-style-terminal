# Milestone 4 Complete - Sidebar Tree Navigator

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**  
**Date: 2024-12-19**

## Overview

Milestone 4 has been successfully implemented, providing a fully functional sidebar tree navigator for the tree-style terminal application. All core requirements have been met according to the architecture specification.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. TreeStore Setup
- **✅ `Gtk.TreeStore` with `[object, title]` columns** implemented in `controllers/sidebar.py`
- **✅ Event binding through refresh mechanism** - Sessions are synchronized via `SessionManager` callbacks and `refresh()` calls
- Full `SidebarController` class with methods for adding, removing, updating sessions
- Session-to-TreeIter mapping for efficient operations

### 2. Gtk.TreeView Widget
- **✅ `SessionSidebar(Gtk.Box)` class** implemented in `widgets/sidebar.py`
- **✅ TreeView with title column display** - Headers hidden, tree lines enabled, expanders shown
- Proper column configuration with text renderer and ellipsization
- Scrolled window container with automatic scrollbar policies

### 3. Revealer & Layout Integration
- **✅ MainWindow layout** with horizontal box containing sidebar and terminal area
- **✅ `Gtk.Revealer` for collapsible sidebar** with slide-right transition
- **✅ Toggle button in HeaderBar** for expanding/collapsing sidebar
- CSS classes applied for theming support

### 4. Selection & Focus Management
- **✅ Row selection callbacks** implemented with `set_selection_callback()`
- **✅ Focus switching to corresponding `TerminalSession`** through `SessionManager`
- **✅ Active session display** in terminal area via `Gtk.Stack`
- Programmatic selection support with `select_session()` method

## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### Core Components Created

1. **`SessionSidebar` Widget** (`widgets/sidebar.py`)
   - Encapsulates TreeView with proper GTK widget inheritance
   - Handles selection events and provides callback interface
   - Supports expand/collapse operations and refresh functionality

2. **`SessionManager` Controller** (`controllers/session_manager.py`)
   - High-level API for session lifecycle management
   - Coordinates between `SessionTree` model and VTE terminal widgets
   - Implements callbacks for session created/closed/selected events
   - Provides `new_session()`, `new_child()`, `new_sibling()`, `close_session()` methods

3. **Enhanced `SidebarController`** (`controllers/sidebar.py`)
   - Manages synchronization between `SessionTree` and `Gtk.TreeStore`
   - Provides efficient session-to-TreeIter mapping
   - Implements adoption algorithm support through tree operations

4. **Integrated MainWindow** (`main.py`)
   - Connects all components together
   - Handles UI events and delegates to appropriate controllers
   - Manages terminal widget lifecycle and stack switching

### Event Flow Implementation

```
User Action → SessionManager → SessionTree → SidebarController → SessionSidebar
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Session Created → Terminal Widget → TreeStore Update → TreeView Refresh → UI Update
```

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Verification Script
- Created `verify_milestone4.py` with comprehensive test suite
- Tests TreeStore setup, widget implementation, selection handling, and integration
- All tests pass successfully

### Manual Testing
- Application starts without errors
- Sidebar toggles correctly with smooth animations
- Session creation works through both new session buttons
- TreeView displays session hierarchy properly
- Selection callbacks function as expected

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/tree_style_terminal/widgets/sidebar.py` - SessionSidebar widget
- `src/tree_style_terminal/controllers/session_manager.py` - High-level session management
- `verify_milestone4.py` - Comprehensive verification script

### Modified Files
- `src/tree_style_terminal/main.py` - Integration with new components
- `src/tree_style_terminal/controllers/sidebar.py` - Event binding clarification
- `TODO.md` - Marked Milestone 4 tasks as complete

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **Complete TreeView Integration** - Sidebar properly displays session hierarchy with expand/collapse support
2. **Seamless Selection Handling** - Clicking sessions in sidebar switches terminal focus immediately
3. **Robust Session Management** - Full lifecycle management with proper adoption algorithm
4. **Clean Architecture** - Clear separation between domain models, controllers, and widgets
5. **Event Synchronization** - Reliable synchronization between tree model and UI without complex signal systems

## 🔄 Integration Points

- **With Terminal Widgets**: SessionManager coordinates VTE terminal creation and lifecycle
- **With Session Tree**: SidebarController maintains TreeStore synchronization
- **With Main UI**: Window handles events and delegates to appropriate controllers
- **With Future Milestones**: Foundation ready for keyboard shortcuts (Milestone 5) and theming (Milestone 6)

## 📋 Technical Notes

### Event Binding Strategy
- Implemented through callback system rather than GObject signals
- SessionManager coordinates updates through widget refresh calls
- Provides clean separation and avoids complexity in domain models
- Sufficient for current requirements with room for future enhancement

### Performance Considerations
- Session-to-TreeIter mapping provides O(1) lookup performance
- TreeStore operations are efficient for typical session counts
- UI updates only triggered when necessary through selective refresh

## ✅ Milestone 4 Requirements Met

All TODO items for Milestone 4 have been completed:

- ✅ TreeStore with columns [object, title] 
- ✅ SessionTree event binding to TreeStore updates
- ✅ SessionSidebar(Gtk.Box) class with Gtk.TreeView
- ✅ Display column for title
- ✅ Layout with sidebar and terminal area
- ✅ Gtk.Revealer for collapsible sidebar  
- ✅ Button in HeaderBar for expanding/collapsing
- ✅ Callback for row selection with focus switching
- ✅ Show active session in terminal area

**Ready to proceed to Milestone 5: Session Control & Shortcuts**
